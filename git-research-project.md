## Sub-questions
### Historical Context:

### a. How did source code management practices evolve before Git?

Before Git, source code management (SCM) practices evolved through several stages, each introducing new concepts and tools to address the growing complexity of software development. Here's a brief overview of this evolution:

### Early Practices
- **Manual Versioning**: Initially, developers manually managed versions of their code by renaming files or directories with version numbers or dates. This method was error-prone and lacked any form of automation or collaboration support.

### First-Generation Version Control Systems (VCS)
- **Revision Control System (RCS)**: Introduced in the early 1980s, RCS was one of the first tools to automate version control. It used a locking mechanism to prevent multiple developers from editing the same file simultaneously, which helped avoid conflicts but limited collaboration.

### Second-Generation VCS
- **Concurrent Versions System (CVS)**: Developed in the late 1980s, CVS improved upon RCS by allowing multiple developers to work on the same project concurrently. It introduced the concept of merging changes, although it still relied on a central repository.
- **Subversion (SVN)**: Released in 2000, SVN aimed to address some of the limitations of CVS. It provided better support for binary files, improved branching and merging capabilities, and more robust handling of large projects.

### Proprietary and Specialized Systems
- **Perforce**: Popular in enterprise environments, Perforce offered high performance and scalability, making it suitable for large codebases and teams. It also provided advanced features like atomic commits and fine-grained access control.
- **BitKeeper**: Used by the Linux kernel project before Git, BitKeeper was a distributed version control system (DVCS) that introduced many concepts later adopted by Git. However, it was proprietary, which led to its eventual replacement.

### Transition to Distributed VCS
- **Git**: Created by Linus Torvalds in 2005, Git revolutionized SCM by fully embracing a distributed model. This allowed every developer to have a complete copy of the repository, enabling offline work and reducing reliance on a central server. Git's efficient branching and merging, along with its speed and flexibility, quickly made it the preferred choice for many developers.

### Key Takeaways
- **Centralized vs. Distributed**: Earlier systems like CVS and SVN were centralized, meaning they relied on a single central repository. Git, on the other hand, is distributed, allowing for greater flexibility and resilience.
- **Collaboration and Conflict Resolution**: Over time, SCM tools evolved to better support collaboration and conflict resolution, moving from simple locking mechanisms to more sophisticated merging strategies.
- **Performance and Scalability**: Modern tools like Git offer significant performance improvements and can handle large projects with ease, addressing the limitations of earlier systems.

### b. What were the limitations of previous version control systems (VCS) that Git aimed to address?

Git was designed to overcome several limitations of earlier version control systems (VCS). Here are some key issues that Git aimed to address:
